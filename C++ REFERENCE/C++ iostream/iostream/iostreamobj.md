C++ iostream objects
The <iostream> library provides objects which can read user input and output data to the console or to a file.

A list of all iostream objects can be found in the table below.


| Object | Description                                                                  |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| cerr   | An output stream for error messages                                          |
| clog   | An output stream to log program information                                  |
| cin    | An input stream that reads keyboard input from the console by default        |
| cout   | An output stream which writes output to the console by default               |
| wcerr  | The same as cerr but outputs wide char (wchar_t) data rather than char data  |
| wclog  | The same as clog but outputs wide char (wchar_t) data rather than char data  |
| wcin   | The same as cin but interprets each input character as a wide char (wchar_t) |
| wcout  | The same as cout but outputs wide char (wchar_t) data rather than char data  |
