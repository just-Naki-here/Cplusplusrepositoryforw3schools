C++ Math
C++ has many functions that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.

Max and min
The max(x,y) function can be used to find the highest value of x and y:

Example
cout << max(5, 10);

And the min(x,y) function can be used to find the lowest value of x and y:

Example
cout << min(5, 10);


C++ <cmath> Library
Other functions, such as sqrt (square root), round (rounds a number) and log (natural logarithm), can be found in the <cmath> header file:

Example
// Include the cmath library
#include <cmath>

cout << sqrt(64);
cout << round(2.6);
cout << log(2);
