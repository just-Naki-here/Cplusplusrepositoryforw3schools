Real-Life Examples
Let's get a bit more practical!

Often in our examples, we simplify variable names to match their data type (myInt or myNum for int types, myChar for char types, and so on). This is done to avoid confusion.

However, for a practical example of using variables, we have created a program that stores different data about a college student:

\\Example\\
// Student data
int studentID = 15;
int studentAge = 23;
float studentFee = 75.25;
char studentGrade = 'B';

// Print variables
cout << "Student ID: " << studentID << "\n";
cout << "Student Age: " << studentAge << "\n";
cout << "Student Fee: " << studentFee << "\n";
cout << "Student Grade: " << studentGrade << "\n";

Calculate the Area of a Rectangle
In this real-life example, we create a program to calculate the area of a rectangle (by multiplying the length and width):

\\Example\\
// Create integer variables
int length = 4;
int width = 6;
int area;

// Calculate the area of a rectangle
area = length * width;

// Print the variables
cout << "Length is: " << length << "\n";
cout << "Width is: " << width << "\n";
cout << "Area of the rectangle is: " << area << "\n";
