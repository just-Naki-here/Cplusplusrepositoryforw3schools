Boolean Expression
A Boolean expression returns a boolean value, which is either 1 (true) or 0 (false).

This is useful for building logic and finding answers.
You can use a comparison operator, such as the greater than (>) operator, to find out if an expression (or variable) is true or false:

Example
int x = 10;
int y = 9;
cout << (x > y); // returns 1 (true), because 10 is higher than 9
Or even easier:

Example
cout << (10 > 9); // returns 1 (true), because 10 is higher than 9

In the examples below, we use the equal to (==) operator to evaluate an expression:

Example
int x = 10;
cout << (x == 10);  // returns 1 (true), because the value of x is equal to 10
Example
cout << (10 == 15);  // returns 0 (false), because 10 is not equal to 15
