Real-Life Examples
Here's a real-life example of using different data types, to calculate and output the total cost of a number of items:

Example
// Create variables of different data types
int items = 50;
double cost_per_item = 9.99;
double total_cost = items * cost_per_item;
char currency = '$';

// Print variables
cout << "Number of items: " << items << "\n";
cout << "Cost per item: " << cost_per_item << "" << currency << "\n";
cout << "Total cost = " << total_cost << "" << currency << "\n";
