C++ Operators
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

Example
int x = 100 + 50;
Although the + operator is often used to add together two values, like in the example above, it can also be used to add together a variable and a value, or a variable and another variable:

Example
int sum1 = 100 + 50;        // 150 (100 + 50)
int sum2 = sum1 + 250;      // 400 (150 + 250)
int sum3 = sum2 + sum2;     // 800 (400 + 400)
C++ divides the operators into the following groups:

Bitwise operators

Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.
Operator	Name	        Description     	                      Example
+         	Addition    	Adds together two values                  	x + y
-       	Subtraction	    Subtracts one value from another         	x - y
*	        Multiplication	Multiplies two values                     	x * y
/        	Division	    Divides one value by another              	x / y
%          	Modulus	        Returns the division remainder	            x % y
++	        Increment	    Increases the value of a variable by 1  	++x
--	        Decrement	    Decreases the value of a variable by 1   	--x
