Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

In the example below, we use the assignment operator (=) to assign the value 10 to a variable called x:

Example
int x = 10;
The addition assignment operator (+=) adds a value to a variable:

Example
int x = 10;
x += 5;
