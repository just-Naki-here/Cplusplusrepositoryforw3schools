## Overview

A reference variable is a "reference" to an existing variable, and it is created with the & operator:

string food = "Pizza"; // food variable
string &meal = food; // reference to food
Now, we can use either the variable name food or the reference name meal to refer to the food variable:

## Example 1

```cpp
string food = "Pizza";
string &meal = food;

cout << food << "\n"; // Outputs Pizza
cout << meal << "\n"; // Outputs Pizza
```
