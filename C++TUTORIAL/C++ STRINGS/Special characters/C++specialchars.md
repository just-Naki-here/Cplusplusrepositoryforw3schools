Strings - Special Characters
Because strings must be written within quotes, C++ will misunderstand this string, and generate an error:

string txt = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north.";
The solution to avoid this problem, is to use the backslash escape character.

The backslash (\) escape character turns special characters into string characters:

Escape character	Result	            Description
\'	                   '	            Single quote
\"	                   "	            Double quote
\\	                    \           	Backslash

The sequence \"  inserts a double quote in a string:

Example
string txt = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north.";

The sequence \'  inserts a single quote in a string:

Example
string txt = "It\'s alright.";

The sequence \\  inserts a single backslash in a string:

Example
string txt = "The character \\ is called backslash.";


Other popular escape characters in C++ are:

Escape Character	                Result
\n                              	New Line	
\t	                                Tab
