String Length
To get the length of a string, use the length() function:

Example
string txt = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
cout << "The length of the txt string is: " << txt.length();
Tip: You might see some C++ programs that use the size() function to get the length of a string. This is just an alias of length(). It is completely up to you if you want to use length() or size():
Example
string txt = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
cout << "The length of the txt string is: " << txt.size();
